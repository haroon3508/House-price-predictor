# 🏠 House Price Predictor

This is my first machine learning project! It predicts house prices using the California Housing dataset and a basic Linear Regression model.

The entire project was built on **Google Colab using only my phone**, and it's part of my journey to become a machine learning engineer through the apprenticeship route.

## 📊 What the Project Does

- Loads a real-world dataset of housing information in California
- Trains a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices
- Tests the model and evaluates accuracy using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **pandas** – for data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating the ML model
- **Google Colab** – for running everything in the cloud

---

## 📈 Project Output

- The model outputs a **Mean Squared Error** (MSE) of around **0.55**, meaning the average squared error in predictions is ~$55,000.
- This is a solid result for a first-time model with basic preprocessing.

## 🙋 About Me

I’m a student in scotland discovering ML

---

## 📬 Future Plans

- Add data visualizations (matplotlib)
- Try more ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Tweak features to improve accuracy
- Deploy future projects using Streamlit or Flask
